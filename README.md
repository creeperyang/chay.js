# chay.js

A simple and lightweight JavaScript **mvvm** framework.

**Note:** the project is strongly inspired by [simple-mvvm](https://github.com/furybean/simple-mvvm). And, the project aims to create a more powerful and efficient `mvvm` framework.

## Why this framework?

Building a `mvvm` framework from the ground up will help learning the principles of `mvvm` a lot. And if the framework works well, it could be a good alternative for `Angular.js` and other mvvm frameworks(wow, it's surely far away from the goal currently).
